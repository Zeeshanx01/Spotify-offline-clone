# Spotify Offline Clone

The music library website is a Spotify clone that enables users to browse folders of music files. When a folder is selected, songs are displayed in a sidebar, and the first track plays automatically. The green playbar at the bottom features controls for play, pause, fast forward, rewind, and a seekbar, along with the current song name and playback time.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For structuring the website.
- **CSS**: For styling the interface.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing audio playback and dynamic song loading.
